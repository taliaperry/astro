<p class="firstonindex">The mariner's astrolabe, also known as the nautical astrolabe, is an instrument used for measuring the sun's altitude in order to determine the latitude of a ship at sea. Its utility was recognized by the late fifteenth century, and these objects (in their many forms) proved citical to navigation in the "Age of Discovery," particularly in their use by Iberian powers. This digital project expands on an existing dataset of known artefacts, providing a number of interactive tools and visualizations, and offers a critical look at a subset of this group through the lense of material culture.</p>

The title of this project comes from Francisco Rodrigues’s “Chapter To Explain How You Should Navigate By Shadows,” in “The Book of Francisco Rodrigues: Rutter of a Voyage in the Red Sea, Nautical Rules, Almanack and Maps, Written and Drawn in the East before 1515,” trans. and ed. Armando Cortesão, in [<i>The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires and The Book of Francisco Rodrigues, Volume II</i>](https://archive.org/details/McGillLibrary-136388-15666/page/n93/mode/1up) (London: The Hakluyt Society, 1944), 304.
